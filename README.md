- Product detail pages with images and descriptions
- Shopping cart and checkout flow
- Account registration and authentication (email/password, optional OAuth)
- Admin panel for product and order management
- Responsive design for desktop & mobile
- Optional: subscriptions / recurring deliveries

- Homepage: `docs/screenshots/homepage.png`
- Product page: `docs/screenshots/product.png`
- Cart & checkout: `docs/screenshots/checkout.png`
- Admin dashboard: `docs/screenshots/admin.png`

---

## Tech Stack

Suggested default stack (change to fit your implementation):

- Frontend: React (Vite/Create React App) or Next.js
- Backend: Node.js + Express or NestJS (REST API)
- Database: PostgreSQL (or MySQL / MongoDB)
- Auth: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or sessions; optional OAuth (Google, Apple)
- Payment: Stripe (recommended) or other payment provider
- Containerization: Docker & docker-compose
- Tests: Jest / React Testing Library / Supertest

---

## Getting Started (Developer)

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (LTS recommended, e.g., 18+)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL (or your DB of choice)
- Docker (optional, for containers)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for each service (frontend/backend). Example backend `.env`:

```
# Backend .env
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/coffeebliss
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NODE_ENV=development
```

Example frontend `.env` (if needed):

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
REACT_APP_STRIPE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### Local Setup (Example: Node + React)

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<owner>/coffee-bliss.git
   cd coffee-bliss
   ```

2. Start backend
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   # create .env as shown above
   npm run migrate   # run DB migrations (if applicable)
   npm run dev       # or `npm start`
   ```

3. Start frontend
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev       # or `npm start`
   ```

4. Open the app in browser
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

Adjust ports and commands to match your setup (e.g., Next.js runs on 3000, Vite on 5173).

### Running with Docker

Example `docker-compose.yml` (simplified):

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: coffee
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: coffee
      POSTGRES_DB: coffeebliss
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  api:
    build: ./backend
    env_file: ./backend/.env
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"

  web:
    build: ./frontend
    env_file: ./frontend/.env
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - api

volumes:
  db-data:
```

Start:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## Usage (User)

- Browse the catalog, filter by origin or roast level.
- Add items to the cart and proceed to checkout.
- Register or log in to view order history and manage subscriptions.
- Admin users can manage inventory and fulfill orders via the dashboard.

---

## Testing

- Backend unit & integration tests (example)
  ```
  cd backend
  npm test
  ```

- Frontend tests
  ```
  cd frontend
  npm test
  ```

Consider adding CI (GitHub Actions) to run tests on push/PR.

---

## Linting & Formatting

- ESLint for JS/TS linting
- Prettier for formatting
- Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks

Example:
```
npm run lint
npm run format
```

---

## Deployment

Popular options:
- Vercel / Netlify for frontend
- Heroku, Railway, Fly.io for backend
- Dockerized deploy to AWS ECS / DigitalOcean / Render
- Use managed PostgreSQL for production

Be sure to:
- Use secure environment variables (secrets manager)
- Enable HTTPS and set secure cookie flags
- Configure CORS for production domains
- Configure Stripe/webhook endpoints and verify signatures

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!

- Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
- Commit changes with clear messages
- Open a Pull Request describing the change and related issue
- Add tests where applicable
- Follow the code style conventions used in the repo

See CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed guidelines (create one if missing).

---

## Roadmap

Planned improvements:
- Subscriptions / recurring deliveries
- Advanced search & recommendations
- Multi-vendor support for local roasters
- Mobile app (React Native / Flutter)
- Internationalization (i18n)

---

## License

Specify your license here (e.g., MIT). Example:

This project is licensed under the MIT License — see the LICENSE file for details.
